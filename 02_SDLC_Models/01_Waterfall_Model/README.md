## What is The Waterfall Model?

The Waterfall model is a methodical and step-by-step process for creating software, progressing through distinct phases such as planning, requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, and deployment. This approach mandates the completion of each phase before moving on to the next, ensuring a structured and logical development process.

## Why Do We Use the Waterfall Model?

The Waterfall model is utilized for its well-organized and efficient approach to software development. It ensures high quality and productivity by addressing all requirements in each phase before progressing. It is particularly suitable for projects requiring precision, attention to detail, and stable environments.

## Features of the Waterfall Model

The Waterfall model is characterized by its emphasis on documentation, adherence to predefined schedules, clear linear structure, and a highly structured and disciplined approach. These features contribute to efficient resource allocation, timely completion, and better project management.

## Different Phases of Waterfall Model in Software Engineering

The Waterfall model follows a traditional, linear, and sequential process, encompassing several distinct phases. Each phase has specific objectives and deliverables:

1. **Requirements analysis and specification phase:**

    - The aim of this phase is to understand the exact requirements of the customer and to document them properly. 
    - Both the customer and the software developer work together so as to document all the functions, performance, and interfacing requirement of the software.

    - A large document called Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document is created which contained a detailed description of what the system will do in the common language.

## When to use SDLC Waterfall Model?

The Waterfall Model is suitable in scenarios where:

- **Well-defined and stable requirements:** Ideal when project requirements are clear, unambiguous, and unlikely to change significantly during development.
- **Small-scale projects:** Effective for managing smaller projects with limited complexity.
- **Projects with fixed budgets and timelines:** Useful when projects have strict budgetary constraints or tight deadlines.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model

**Advantages:**
- Clear and well-defined project requirements.
- Sequential structure allows for easy planning and scheduling.
- Easier management and control of project progress.
- Well-documented process facilitates onboarding of new team members.

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited flexibility in accommodating changes in requirements.
- Reduced client involvement during development.
- High risk of project failure if initial requirements need correction.
- Difficulty in estimating accurate timelines and costs upfront.

## Applications of Classical Waterfall Model

The classical Waterfall model is widely applied in software development projects with:

- Well-defined and stable requirements.
- Large-scale projects with a long duration.
- Strict regulatory or compliance requirements.
- Clients preferring a linear and predictable development process.

## Waterfall Model and Tools

Tools associated with the Waterfall Model include:

1. **Gantt chart:** Essential for visually planning and tracking sequential phases of the project.

2. **Requirement traceability matrix:** Maintains a clear link between project requirements and corresponding design, development, and testing activities.

3. **Documentation tools:** Capture detailed project specifications, design documents, test plans, and user manuals.

4. **Version control systems:** Manage different versions of software or code throughout development.

## Difference between Waterfall Model and Agile Model

The Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential approach, while the Agile Model is iterative and flexible, emphasizing collaboration and adaptability throughout development.

## Who uses the waterfall model?

The Waterfall Model is widely used by project teams and managers in various fields, including construction, manufacturing, IT, and software development.
