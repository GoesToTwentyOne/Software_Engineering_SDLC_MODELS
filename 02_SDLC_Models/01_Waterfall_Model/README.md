## What is The Waterfall Model?

The Waterfall model is a methodical and step-by-step process for creating software, progressing through distinct phases such as planning, requirements gathering, system design, implementation, testing, and deployment. This approach mandates the completion of each phase before moving on to the next, ensuring a structured and logical development process.

## Why Do We Use the Waterfall Model?

This model is used for the following purposes:

- The Waterfall model is a well-organized and efficient approach to software development.
- This model ensures that all requirements related to a particular phase are met before moving on to the next phase, resulting in high quality and productivity.
- By adhering to this model, developers can ensure that all software development life cycle aspects are properly addressed.
- This model leads to a more streamlined and organized final product.
- The Waterfall model is particularly suitable for software development projects requiring high precision and attention to detail.

## Features of the Waterfall Model

The waterfall model is a widely used software development approach structured in a strict sequence of steps.

- One of the key features of the waterfall model is its emphasis on documentation, which is critical for achieving traceability and ensuring that the software meets the desired requirements.
- Another important characteristic of the waterfall model is its strict adherence to a predefined schedule, which can help to ensure that the project is completed on time and within budget.
- The model features a clear, linear structure, enabling developers to track progress and identify potential issues early in development.
- The waterfall model is a highly structured and disciplined approach to software development that is well-suited to projects with clear and well-defined requirements.

## Different Phases of Waterfall Model in Software Engineering

The Waterfall model follows a traditional, linear, and sequential process, encompassing several distinct phases. Each phase has specific objectives and deliverables:

1. **Requirements analysis and specification phase:**

    - The aim of this phase is to understand the exact requirements of the customer and to document them properly.
    - Both the customer and the software developer work together so as to document all the functions, performance, and interfacing requirement of the software.

    - A large document called Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document is created which contained a detailed description of what the system will do in the common language.
2. **Design Phase:**

    - This phase aims to transform the requirements gathered in the SRS into a suitable form which permits further coding in a programming language.
    - It defines the overall software architecture together with high level and detailed design. All this work is documented as a Software Design Document (SDD).

3. **Implementation and unit testing:**
    - During this phase, design is implemented.
    - If the SDD is complete, the implementation or coding phase proceeds smoothly, because all the information needed by software developers is contained in the SDD.
4. **Integration and System Testing:**
    - This phase is highly crucial as the quality of the product is determined by the effectiveness of the testing carried out.
    - The better output will lead to satisfied customers, lower maintenance costs, and accurate results.
5. **Operation and maintenance phase:**
    - Maintenance is the task performed by every user once the software has been delivered to the customer, installed, and operational.

## When to use SDLC Waterfall Model?

The Waterfall Model is suitable in scenarios where:

- **Well-defined and stable requirements:** Ideal when project requirements are clear, unambiguous, and unlikely to change significantly during development.
- **Small-scale projects:** Effective for managing smaller projects with limited complexity.
- **Projects with fixed budgets and timelines:** Useful when projects have strict budgetary constraints or tight deadlines.
- When resources are well prepared and are available to use.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model

**Advantages:**

- This model is simple to implement also the number of resources that are required for it is minimal.
- The requirements are simple and explicitly declared; they remain unchanged during the entire project development.
- The start and end points for each phase is fixed, which makes it easy to cover progress.
- The release date for the complete product, as well as its final cost, can be determined before development.
- It gives easy to control and clarity for the customer due to a strict reporting system.
- Clear and well-defined project requirements.
- Sequential structure allows for easy planning and scheduling.
- Easier management and control of project progress.
- Well-documented process facilitates onboarding of new team members.

**Disadvantages:**

- In this model, the risk factor is higher, so this model is not suitable for more significant and complex projects.
- This model cannot accept the changes in requirements during development.
- It becomes tough to go back to the phase. For example, if the application has now shifted to the coding phase, and there is a change in requirement, It becomes tough to go back and change it.
- Since the testing done at a later stage, it does not allow identifying the challenges and risks in the earlier phase, so the risk reduction strategy is difficult to prepare.
- Limited flexibility in accommodating changes in requirements.
- Reduced client involvement during development.
- High risk of project failure if initial requirements need correction.
- Difficulty in estimating accurate timelines and costs upfront.

## Applications of Classical Waterfall Model

The classical Waterfall model is widely applied in software development projects with:

- Well-defined and stable requirements.
- Large-scale projects with a long duration.
- Strict regulatory or compliance requirements.
- Clients preferring a linear and predictable development process.

## Waterfall Model and Tools

Tools associated with the Waterfall Model include:

1. **Gantt chart:** The Gantt chart is an essential tool in the Waterfall Model, allowing project managers to visually plan and track the sequential phases of the project, ensuring efficient resource allocation and timely completion.
2. **Requirement traceability matrix:** Requirement traceability matrix helps maintain a clear link between the project requirements and their corresponding design, development, and testing activities, enabling effective change management and ensuring all requirements are met.
For example, let’s consider a software development project that aims to create an e-commerce website. The initial requirement states that the website should have a user registration feature. The waterfall model would use the Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) to maintain a clear link between this requirement and subsequent activities.
3. **Documentation tools:** Documentation tools play a significant role in the Waterfall Model by capturing detailed project specifications, design documents, test plans, and user manuals, ensuring thorough documentation for future reference and maintenance.
For example, let’s consider a software development project following the waterfall model. In the initial phase of requirements gathering, the documentation tool is essential in capturing all the detailed project specifications. The team can use tools like Microsoft Word or Google Docs to create a complete requirements document that outlines all the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.

Once the requirements are documented, the design phase begins. Here, UML (Unified Modeling Language) modeling tools such as Enterprise Architect or Lucidchart can be utilized to create detailed design documents. These tools allow developers to visually represent system architecture, class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and other design elements necessary for building the software.

Test management tools like TestRail or JIRA can help create test plans and track test cases during the testing phase. These tools enable testers to document various test scenarios, expected and actual results for each test case. This ensures that all aspects of the software are thoroughly tested before moving on to the next stage.
4. **Version control systems:** Version control systems aid in managing different versions of software or code throughout the development process in the Waterfall Model, allowing developers to track changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain a reliable source code repository.

For example, let’s consider a software development project following the waterfall model. The team consists of multiple developers working on different software modules simultaneously. To ensure smooth collaboration and efficient management of code versions, they utilize a version control system (VCS) like Git. At the beginning of the project, the team sets up a central repository on a platform like GitHub or Bitbucket. Each developer creates a branch from the main branch to work on their module. This branching mechanism allows them to work independently without interfering with each other’s code.

They regularly commit changes to their branches in the VCS, providing detailed commit messages describing what modifications were made. This helps keep track of individual contributions and understand the codebase’s evolution.

## Difference between Waterfall Model and Agile Model

What is the difference between Waterfall Model and Agile Model? The Waterfall Model is a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. In contrast, the Agile Model is an iterative and flexible approach emphasizing collaboration and adaptability throughout development. Agile allows for frequent feedback and adjustments, while Waterfall follows a predetermined plan with limited room for changes. Who uses the waterfall model? Many project teams and managers rely on the waterfall model to meet their business needs and achieve their goals. This model is widely used in various project management fields, including construction, manufacturing, IT, and software development.
